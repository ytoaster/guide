Guide to making Mac OS X 10.8 (or 10.7-10.9) more usable in 2025.
## Browsers
Most operating systems nowadays are used as a bootloader for the web browser. For most people to be able to comfortably daily-drive an OS you need a fairly recently updated browser.

Here are your options:

 - [Arctic Fox](https://github.com/rmottola/Arctic-Fox) by rmottola
 For Mac OS 10.6+. Based on Pale moon 27. Will be able to browse most websites with [Palefill](https://martok.github.io/palefill/) installed.
 - [Chromium Legacy](https://github.com/blueboxd/chromium-legacy) by blueboxd (Recommended by me)
 For Mac OS 10.7+. Based on mostly latest Chromium builds. Will be able to browse almost all websites, but resource heavy (like most Chromium based browsers).
 - [InterWeb](https://github.com/wicknix/InterWebSnow) by wicknix (discontinued)
 For Mac OS 10.6 - 10.7. Based on Basilisk/Firefox ESR 52
 ### Extensions
 
 - Firefox based:
 Use the [Pale moon Add-ons Site](https://addons.palemoon.org/extensions/) for Arctic Fox
 Use the [Basilisk Add-ons Site](https://addons.basilisk-browser.org/) for InterWeb
 - Chromium based:
Use the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/)
